      <h1>Proverbs 28</h1>
      
      <p>Start by having fear for the Lord. Bear in mind he is the judge, and he will show kindness to the poor and avenge the oppressors.</p>

<p>Be wise and work hard. Make sure you are working hard everyday with what you have. Work in the areas of your life that confirms return. DO NOT try to get rich quick. It never works. Make sure all your income is justly earned. People who work hard with diligence, honesty and patients will be blessed by the Lord.</p>

<p>And when you are blessed with material blessings, make sure you are kind with what you have to those who are in need. The Lord does not love greedy and selfish people. The wealth of a selfish person will be saved for someone who is kind to the needy.</p>

<p>Stop cheating your way in. If you don't learn to hate sly ways to get your own gains you'll fail and drop dead suddenly when you are not expecting.</p>

It's better to be blameless and poor than to be rich and fearful like a rat. The righteous will always have a heart as bold as a lion.</p>
